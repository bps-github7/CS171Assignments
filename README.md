# CS171Assignments
Object Oriented Programs in Python

Some OOP assignments I worked on when first learning to program in Summer 2018

TODO: 

1) general- make a folder for each assignment, with README explaining how to use it, as well as a requirmeents sheet and indivdual todo lists\
2) ALL things should be PEP8 compliant and make use of industry best practices.

3) implement a userinterface for each of these projects, maybe a website to display all of them on different pages
4) need to improve scripting in most files, make them all more feature enriched
5) get all the class files compliant with the descriptor protocol (no need for get and set methods, assuming the class inherits from object)

next you will want to do this for java and CS671 (need to make new repo for that one)
